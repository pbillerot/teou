    <h1>Welcome in TEOU</h1>
    <p><br>
      TEOU, an application that returns the location of the device upon receipt
      of an SMS "<strong>teou</strong>".<br>
      The answer will be in the form of an SMS "<strong>suila</strong>" with the
      link to the <strong>OpenStreetMap</strong> map and the position of the
      device.<br>
      <br>
      The location system will not be activated continuously, the battery of the
      device will be well preserved.<br>
      Also, this application works without internet connection to provide the
      position of the device.<br>
      <br>
      A person (who has not installed the app TEOU on his smartphone) can know
      your location by simply sending a SMS "<strong>teou</strong>" to your
      device.<br>
      He will receive back the SMS "<strong>suila</strong>" followed by the link
      of your position.<br>
      He need only click on the link for the map and your position in the
      browser's device connected to the internet.<br>
      <br>
      The application automatically displays the map OpenStreetMap following
      receipt of the SMS "<strong>suila</strong>" (if the device has an internet
      connection).<br>
      <br>
      The application has an interface</p>
    <ul>
      <li>to declare the contacts you want to know the position and the even
        allow them to send you SMS "<strong>teou</strong>"</li>
      <li>to save the card link</li>
      <li>to send then map link to a contact via SMS</li>
      <li>to view the proposed itineary (on foot, by bike, by car) from your
        location to the pint of map</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
