TEOU, an application that returns the location of the device upon receipt of an SMS "teou".
The answer will be in the form of an SMS "suila" with the link to the OpenStreetMap map and the position of the device.

The location system will not be activated continuously, the battery of the device will be well preserved.
Also, this application works without internet connection to provide the position of the device.

A person (who has not installed the app TEOU on his smartphone) can know your location by simply sending a SMS "teou" in your device.
He will receive back the SMS "suila" followed by the link of your position.
He need only click on the link for the map and your position in the browser's device connected to the internet.

The application automatically displays the map OpenStreetMap following receipt of the SMS "suila" (if the device has an internet connection).

The application has also an interface
- To declare the contacts you want to know the position and the even allow them to send you SMS "tou"
- To view the location request responses
  Each position called "place" in the application is historicized in the device.
  It will be possible to rename the place, remove, and even send SMS on a person in the contact list.

PERMISSION
